MOBILE CODING CHALLENGE

Build lightweight Android/iOS applications that include features

Use Case
● As user I want to search daily forecast 7 days of a city
● As user I want to see my history search

Problems:
● Provide the UX/UI searching/history search forecast screen
● Caching the result of the search to prevent requests to the server many times.
● If the network is not available, the application will auto request the query right after the
network back.
● Setup project able to build with 3 environment development, staging, production.
● Encrypt your configuration to prevent getting the server configuration(like appId).

Approach:
● Using OpenCage API to convert the city to latlong
● Using OpenWeather API to convert latlong to forecast data

Materials:
1. OpenCagedata API.
2. Open Weather API.
3. UI: Please feel free to provide your best UX/UI
